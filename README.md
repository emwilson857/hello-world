# hello-world
a place where I store ideas, resources, or even share and discuss things with others.
My name is Ellen Wilson and I want to learn to code and even transition to a career as a web developer. I love Jesus, my Catholic faith, I enjoy crocheting, reading, drinking coffee and going for walks. I'm really close with my large family and fantastic friends who fill my days with love and laughter.
